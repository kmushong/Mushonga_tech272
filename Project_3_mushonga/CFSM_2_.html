                    <h3>Early life</h3>
                    <p><a href="#top">top</a></p>

                    <p>Leonard Albert Kravitz was born on May 26, <time datetime="1964">1964</time>, in New York City,[7] the only child of NBC television news producer Sy Kravitz (1924–2005) and actress Roxie Roker (<time datetime="1929">1929</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1995">1995</time>).[8] His mother came from a Christian family that was of African-American and Bahamian descent.[9][10][11][12] His father was of Ukrainian-Jewish origin.[13][14][15] Through his mother, Kravitz is a second cousin of television weather presenter Al Roker,[16] as their grandfathers were brothers.[17] Kravitz was named after his uncle, Leonard M. Kravitz, a private first class who was killed in action in the Korean War at the age of 20, while single-handedly holding off a Chinese attack, enabling most of his platoon to escape.[18][a]</p>

                    <p>During his early years, Kravitz did not grow up in a religious environment.[20] After a spiritual experience when he was 13, he started attending church and later became a non-denominational Christian.[20][21] Kravitz grew up spending weekdays on the Upper East Side of Manhattan with his parents, attending P.S. 6 for elementary school, and spending weekends at his grandmother Bessie's house in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.[22]</p>

                    <p>Kravitz began banging on pots and pans in the kitchen, playing them as drums at the age of three. He decided that he wanted to be a musician at the age of five. He began playing the drums and soon added guitar. He grew up listening to the music his parents listened to: R&B, jazz, classical, opera, gospel, and blues. He said, "My parents were very supportive of the fact that I loved music early on, and they took me to a lot of shows."[23][24] Around the age of seven, he saw the Jackson 5 perform at Madison Square Garden, and they became his favorite performers.[25] His father, who was also a jazz promoter, was friends with Duke Ellington, Sarah Vaughan, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Bobby Short, Miles Davis, and other jazz greats; Ellington even played "Happy Birthday" for him on his fifth birthday.[26][27][28]</p>

                    <p>In <time datetime="1974">1974</time>, at the age of 10, Kravitz relocated to Los Angeles with his parents when his mother landed her role on The Jeffersons.[22] At his mother's urging, he joined the California Boys Choir for three years, where he performed a classical repertoire, and sang with the Metropolitan Opera. He took part in Mahler's Third Symphony at the Hollywood Bowl.[22] It was in Los Angeles that Kravitz was introduced to rock music, listening to the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, the Grateful Dead, Aerosmith, Black Sabbath, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Kiss, Pink Floyd, and the Who,[25] and he said he was "attracted to the cool style, the girls, the rock 'n' roll lifestyle."[25] During his junior high school years, he was also introduced to marijuana; he has stated that he was a "pothead" during his youth.[29] His other musical influences at the time included Fela Kuti, Bill Withers, Marvin Gaye, Pharoah Sanders, and Miles Davis.[25] Later influences came in the form of John Lennon and Bob Marley. Kravitz attended Beverly Hills High School, where he was classmates with Maria McKee, Nicolas Cage, and Slash. He taught himself to play piano and bass and made friends with Zoro, who would later become his long-time collaborator.[30] His parents divorced in <time datetime="1985">1985</time>.[31]</p>

                    <p>Kravitz is the honorary nephew of Diahann Carroll, whom he called Aunt D,[32][33][34] and actress Cicely Tyson was his godmother.[32]</p>

                    <h3>Career</h3>
                    <p><a href="#top">top</a></p>
    
                    <h4><p><time datetime="1985">1985</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1990">1990</time>: Virgin Records and career debut</p></h4>

                    <p>With record labels still telling him his music was not "black enough" or "white enough", Kravitz decided to record an album on his own under the name Romeo Blue.[22] Kravitz had met the recording engineer, keyboardist, and bassist Henry Hirsch in <time datetime="1985">1985</time> when recording a demo at his Hoboken, New Jersey, recording studio. The two shared an interest in using real instruments and vintage recording equipment, as well as a love of R&B, jazz, and rock. Kravitz would go on to collaborate with Hirsch on most of his albums. Kravitz began working on his debut album with Hirsch over the next year and a half, with Kravitz's father paying for the studio time. Kravitz met saxophonist Karl Denson and invited him to play on the song "Let Love Rule". Kravitz was so impressed with his playing that Denson played on much of the album. Beginning in the late 1980s, Denson toured with Kravitz for five years.[35]</p>

                    <p>In October <time datetime="1988">1988</time>, after completing most of the recording, Kravitz approached friend Stephen Elvis Smith, who had served as the music supervisor on Lisa Bonet's The Cosby Show spin-off A Different World. Smith had also worked with Kravitz's mother on the hit sitcom The Jeffersons. Kravitz urged Smith to manage his career and assist him in finding a record deal. In less than a month of shopping the recordings, five labels (Warner Bros, Elektra, Geffen, Capitol, and Virgin) were in a bidding war for Kravitz. Eventually, a deal was made with Virgin Records in January <time datetime="1989">1989</time>, and signed by Virgin A&R executive Nancy Jeffries. The label was "excited" about the music he was making, music inspired by his relationship with wife Bonet and their new daughter, Zoe. On Smith's urging, Kravitz dropped the name Romeo Blue and reclaimed the Lenny Kravitz moniker. About his time as Romeo Blue, Kravitz said, "Ultimately, it got me back to myself. And when I finally did accept myself for myself, music started flowing out of me."[24]</p>

                    <p>Kravitz released his debut album Let Love Rule in 1989, a combination of rock and funk with a <time datetime="1960">1960</time>s vibe. Music critics were mixed: some felt Kravitz was a gifted new artist, others felt he was overpowered by his musical influences. The album was a moderate success in the United States, but became an instant hit outside of the US, especially in Europe. Lisa Bonet directed the debut music video for the title track, "Let Love Rule". Stephen Smith signed Kravitz with talent booking agency CAA, who soon were fielding offers for Kravitz, first on a club tour, and then in opening slots for Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Bob Dylan, and David Bowie. Having played essentially all of the instruments on the album, Kravitz had to quickly assemble a touring band to support the Let Love Rule release. In May <time datetime="2009">2009</time>, a 20th-anniversary deluxe edition of Let Love Rule was released worldwide by Virgin. Kravitz launched a LLR(20) tour of Europe and the United States in support of the re-release.[36][37][38]</p>

                    <p>In May <time datetime="1990">1990</time>, he performed the song "Cold Turkey" at the John Lennon Memorial concert.[39] In <time datetime="1990">1990</time>, Kravitz produced the song "Justify My Love" for Madonna, which he co-wrote with Ingrid Chavez.[22] The song, which appeared on her greatest hits album The Immaculate Collection and created controversy because of its explicit video, went to number 1 for two consecutive weeks. Kravitz appeared as a member of Peace Choir that performed "Give Peace a Chance" in <time datetime="1991">1991</time> in protest of the Gulf War.[22]</p>

                    <p>Kravitz separated from Lisa Bonet in <time datetime="1991">1991</time>,[40] amid rumors of an affair between him and Madonna. Kravitz has denied any infidelity.[40] Kravitz and Bonet divorced in <time datetime="1993">1993</time>. Kravitz produced the self-titled album Vanessa Paradis (<time datetime="1991">1991</time>) for French singer and actress Vanessa Paradis. He played most of the instruments and co-wrote most of the songs on the album.</p>

                    <p>In <time datetime="1991">1991</time>, Kravitz released his second album, Mama Said,[22] which was his first album to reach the Top 40. The songs on the album were about Bonet and dedicated to her, documenting his depression over their breakup.[27] The single, "It Ain't Over 'til It's Over", went to number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. A second single "Always on the Run", a tribute to his mother,[27] featured Slash on guitar. "Stand by My Woman" and "What Goes Around Comes Around" followed. Sean Lennon co-wrote and played piano on the song "All I Ever Wanted".[22]</p>

                    <p>In <time datetime="1993">1992</time>, Kravitz wrote "Line Up" for Aerosmith, and appeared on Mick Jagger's solo album, Wandering Spirit, on a cover of the Bill Withers soul classic "Use Me", and played guitar on the title track of David Bowie's The Buddha of Suburbia. That year Kravitz also worked with idols Al Green and Curtis Mayfield. In 1993, Are You Gonna Go My Way was released, reaching number 12 on the Billboard 200 and Kravitz earned a BRIT Award for best international male artist in <time datetime="1994">1994</time>. The title track won a MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video for the video produced by Mark Romanek, in which Kravitz slung his dreadlocks and wore high-heeled platform boots. During the presentation of the MTV Video Music Awards, he performed the song with John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin on bass. Several singles from the album would follow, including "Believe", "Is There Any Love In Your Heart", and "Heaven Help/Spinning Around Over You". This album was the first to feature guitarist Craig Ross, who has also played on all his subsequent albums.[41] One song, "Eleutheria", was influenced by the island Eleuthera in The Bahamas where Kravitz built a house and recording studio.[27] In 1993, he also released the EP Spinning Around Over You, which included four live tracks from his Universal Love Tour. A feature documentary about his 1994 tour entitled Alive from Planet Earth was directed by Doug Nichol and released.</p>

                    <p>In <time datetime="1994">1994</time>, Kravitz recorded "Main Squeeze" with Teena Marie from her Passion Play CD. Kravitz also made a video to pay tribute to Teena Marie when she suddenly died on December 26, <time datetime="2010">2010</time>. He recorded a funk-rock version of the song "Deuce" for the KISS cover album Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved. The track featured Stevie Wonder on harmonica and background vocals.[42] This song was one of three radio singles from the album, and was also the album's lead-off track. Roxie Roker, Kravitz's mother, died in California on December 2, <time datetime="1995">1995</time>, of breast cancer at the age of 66. In <time datetime="1995">1995</time>, Kravitz released the album Circus, which went to number 10 on the Billboard chart on the back of his past achievement. However, the album only had two hit singles: "Rock and Roll Is Dead" and "Can't Get You Off My Mind".</p>

                    <p>With 5 (<time datetime="1998">1998</time>), Kravitz embraced digital technology such as Pro Tools and samplers for the first time. Recorded in both his own New York City carriage house, and Compass Point Studios in The Bahamas, Kravitz employed engineer/producer Terry Manning to handle the recording duties. 5 introduced his music to an even wider audience thanks to the hit single "Fly Away" being featured prominently in both car manufacturer and airline commercials. 5 would reach number 28 on the Billboard 200, with "Fly Away" peaking at number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100, topping both the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks charts, and also topping the charts in Iceland and the United Kingdom. He would win the first of his four consecutive Grammy for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance at the Grammy Awards of <time datetime="1999">1999</time>.[5] Other hits from the album included "If You Can't Say No", that was remixed by dance producer Brian Transeau, and "I Belong to You". For the "I Belong to You" video Kravitz can be seen without his signature dreadlocks. In <time datetime="1999">1999</time> he produced and sang with Cree Summer on her solo album Street Faërie.</p>

                    <p>His cover version of the Guess Who's hit "American Woman" won him another Grammy at the Grammy Awards of <time datetime="2000">2000</time>[5] and helped the Guess Who's song reach a new audience. Kravitz's version of the song originally came from the soundtrack of Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was added to 5 as a bonus track in <time datetime="1999">1999</time>. Kravitz worked on two songs for Michael Jackson's Invincible album released in <time datetime="2001">2001</time>; a snippet of "Another Day" was leaked, and the full version was officially released on the album Michael in <time datetime="2010">2010</time>.[43]</p>

                    <p>Kravitz released a Greatest Hits album in 2000. It proved to be his most successful album, reaching #2 on the Billboard 200 and selling nearly 11 million copies worldwide and ultimately becoming one of the most commercially successful albums of the decade. The single "Again" earned him his third consecutive Grammy for the Best Male Rock Vocal in the Grammy Awards of <time datetime="2001">2001</time>[5] and peaked at number 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100. Kravitz also co-wrote the song "God Gave Me Everything" with Mick Jagger in this period, appearing on Jagger's <time datetime="2001">2001</time> solo album Goddess in the Doorway and in the film Being Mick. In 2001, Kravitz participated in a benefit auction for the Red Hot Organization, in conjunction with Amazon.com to increase public AIDS awareness, which ran from February 28 until April 11, <time datetime="2001">2001</time>. The event featured rare RHO memorabilia and the work of Rolling Stone photographer Mark Seliger.</p>

                    Kravitz released his sixth album Lenny in October 2001. The album was recorded in Miami. Kravitz wrote the song "Bank Robber Man" after the Miami Police Department detained and cuffed him while walking to the gym with his trainer because police stated that he matched the description of a bank robber. Kravitz did not have any identification with him at the time and the police on the scene did not believe that he was indeed Lenny Kravitz. The bank teller who was robbed was then brought to the scene and said Kravitz was not the bank robber. Miami Police later sent officers to Kravitz's home to apologize for the detention. When asked if he thought the incident was a case of racial profiling, Kravitz said he was not sure although some of the lyrics in the song suggest otherwise. The first single from the album, "Dig In", went to number 1 in Argentina and the top 10 in Italy and Portugal. The video for "Dig In" was originally supposed to be shot at the top of the Empire State Building on September 12, <time datetime="2001">2001</time>, but the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, <time datetime="2001">2001</time>, caused the location to be moved. The video was later shot off the coast of Miami. He won his fourth Grammy in <time datetime="2002">2002</time>.[5] "Stillness of Heart", "Believe in Me", and "If I Could Fall In Love" were subsequent singles from the album.</p>
